## 🎯 Project Overview

### Problem Statement

Animal shelters face significant challenges in managing rescue missions, animal records, and adoption processes:

- **Fragmented Communication**: Rescue reports come through multiple untracked channels (phone, social media, walk-ins)
- **Manual Record Keeping**: Paper-based or spreadsheet systems prone to data loss and inconsistency
- **Inefficient Adoption Workflow**: No centralized system to track applications and approvals
- **Limited Visibility**: Lack of real-time dashboards for decision-making and resource allocation
- **Data Integrity Issues**: Difficulty maintaining accurate, up-to-date information across departments
- **Security Concerns**: Insufficient access controls and audit trails for sensitive operations

### Solution: PawRes

PawRes is an integrated management system that provides:

✅ **Centralized Rescue Reporting** - Structured data collection with location tracking and photo uploads  
✅ **Comprehensive Animal Database** - Full lifecycle tracking from rescue to adoption  
✅ **Streamlined Adoption Workflow** - Online applications with automated status management  
✅ **Role-Based Access Control** - Secure separation between admin and public user functions  
✅ **Real-Time Analytics** - Interactive dashboards with trends and insights  
✅ **AI-Powered Classification** - Automated breed detection for faster intake processing  
✅ **Audit Logging** - Complete security trail for compliance and accountability
