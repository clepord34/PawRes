# AI Usage in This Repository

This document lists the specific locations and purposes where AI-assisted tools were used during development. It contains only statements about where AI was applied.

## Tests
- **Purpose:** Generate unit and integration test scaffolding, propose test cases, and suggest fixtures and mocks.
- **Typical Location:** `app/tests/` and test helper files.

## Documentation (Drafting)
- **Purpose:** Draft initial README content, documentation pages, and API/module summaries used as starting points for human editing.
- **Typical Location:** `README.md` and files under the `docs/` directory.

## Complicated Code Sections
- **Purpose:** Suggest approaches, algorithms, refactorings, and implementation ideas for complex or tricky parts of the codebase.
- **Typical Location:** Modules where complex business logic or non-trivial algorithms appear.

## Repetitive or Boilerplate Parts
- **Purpose:** Generate repetitive boilerplate code, templated sections, or repeated test cases to reduce manual copy/paste work.
- **Typical Location:** Boilerplate modules, repeated test patterns, and scaffolding.

## Commit Message Generation
- **Purpose:** Produce suggested commit message text summarizing changes; suggestions served as drafts for human-edited commit messages.

## Debugging Assistance
- **Purpose:** Propose debugging steps, interpret error traces, and suggest targeted fixes to try during troubleshooting.

## Code Cleaning and Refactoring
- **Purpose:** Recommend cleanups such as renaming for clarity, extracting helper functions, and removing obvious dead code.

## Detecting Redundancies
- **Purpose:** Identify redundant code, duplication, and opportunities for consolidation across modules.
